## IAM Policy
  In below code we define policy to give permission to user/group/role
  ```
  const policy  = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17", // Policy language version value
    "Id": "admin-permissions",
    "Statement": [
     {
         "Sid": "1.1",
         "Effect": "Allow",  // Allow or Deny access on resource(s)
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam:1234567890:root"]  // user/account/role
          },
          "Action": [
              "s3:PutObject",
              "s3:GetObject"
          ],
          "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::bucket1/*"]
     }
    ]
   }
  ```

 `Either can either create policy or add already existing policy to user else can also add policy directly to that partifular user as inline policy`

### IAM - Policy Password. 
 `In this we use options to make users to either :-`
  - Not change password
  - Change in every 90 days forced
  - Allow user to change password

### Multi Factor Authentication(MFA)
- This is used as some users may have access to your account and can possibly change anything in resources you have, overuser also.
- So as we want to protect our root user and other users
- MFA= password + security device you login
- You can use Virtual MFA by installing apps like Authy, Google authenticator

### MFA device options - 
 - Google authenticator(phone only)
 - Authy(multi-device) 
 - It is one of type of MFA device asked by aws when you want to enable MFA in your root account/other IAM user accounts.
 - You can enable MFA for your AWS account and for individual IAM users you have created under your account. MFA can be also be used to control access to AWS service APIs.
 - Universal 2nd Factor(U2F) Security Key.eg; Yubikey byYubico(3rd party to aws and is hardware key). Has support for root user and other iam users, provide single key for all so no need to keep tract of keys of users.
 - Hardware key Fob MFA device(provided by Gemalto. by 3rd party to aws).

### IAM MFA Hands on
 - Go to 'My Security Credentials' and then goto MFA and click 'Activate MFA'
 - We will get 3 options: Virtual MFA device, U2F security device, Other hardware MFA device.
